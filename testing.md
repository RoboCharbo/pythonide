### **Updated Section 1: Program Code Requirements**

---

#### **a. A Clear Purpose**
   - Your program should have a well-defined **purpose** or **goal** (e.g., solving a problem, automating a task, creating a simulation, or entertaining users with a game).
   - Example: 
     - **Python**: A program that tracks your fitness goals by calculating daily calorie intake and output.
     - **Snap!**: A game where the user catches falling objects to earn points.

---

#### **b. Functionality**
   - The program must perform a **clear and observable function** that aligns with its stated purpose.
   - It should:
     - Accept at least one **input** from the user, the program, or a file.
     - Produce at least one **output** that demonstrates the program is working as intended.
     - Handle errors or invalid inputs gracefully (optional, but encouraged for clarity).

   - Additional Details:
     - **Input** can come from user prompts, pre-defined data structures (like a list or dictionary), or random generation.
     - **Output** should clearly correspond to the program's purpose and demonstrate its functionality.

   - Example:
     - **Python**: A quiz program that takes user input for answers and outputs the results.
       ```python
       question = "What is the capital of France?"
       answer = input(question)  # Input: User types their answer
       if answer.lower() == "paris":
           print("Correct!")  # Output: A message indicating success
       else:
           print("Try again!")  # Output: A message indicating failure
       ```

---

#### **c. Data Abstraction**
   - Your program must use a data abstraction, such as a **list** or a **dictionary**, to manage complexity and represent multiple pieces of related data in a structured way.

   - Requirements:
     - The data abstraction must store information relevant to your program.
     - The program should include operations that iterate over, modify, or retrieve specific elements from the abstraction.

   - Examples:
     - **Python List**:
       ```python
       scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
       for score in scores:  # Iterate through each score in the list
           print(f"Score: {score}")  # Output: Display each score
       ```

     - **Python Dictionary**:
       ```python
       student_scores = {"Alice": 90, "Bob": 85, "Charlie": 78}
       for student, score in student_scores.items():  # Iterate through key-value pairs
           print(f"{student} scored {score}")  # Output: Display each student's score
       ```

   - Explanation:
     - **Lists** allow for ordered storage and easy iteration over a collection of items.
     - **Dictionaries** are useful for associating data with specific keys, enabling more meaningful relationships between elements.

---

#### **d. A Written Procedure (Function)**
   - The program must include a written **procedure** or **function** that:
     - Has at least one **parameter** as input.
     - Is called at least once in the program.
     - Contains **the algorithm** (see Section 1e) as part of its body.
     - Accomplishes a task that is meaningful and relevant to the program's purpose.

   - Examples:
     - **Defining a Function**:
       ```python
       def calculate_average(numbers):  
           total = 0  # Initialize total to zero
           for number in numbers:  # Iterate through the list of numbers
               total += number  # Add each number to the total
           return total / len(numbers)  # Compute and return the average
       ```

       - **Comments Explanation**:
         - The function takes a **list of numbers** as input (parameter).
         - It uses a loop (**iteration**) to calculate the total of all numbers.
         - The function returns the average (**return statement**).

     - **Calling the Function**:
       ```python
       scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]  # Define a list of scores
       average = calculate_average(scores)  # Call the function with the list as input
       print(f"The average score is {average}")  # Output the calculated average
       ```

       - **Comments Explanation**:
         - The function is **called** with a specific list as input.
         - The return value (average) is stored in the variable `average`.
         - The result is printed to demonstrate functionality.

---

#### **e. An Algorithm**
   - The program must include an **algorithm** that:
     - Demonstrates **sequencing**, **selection**, and **iteration**.
     - Is included within the body of a procedure or function.
     - Performs a meaningful operation relevant to the program's purpose.

   - Requirements:
     - **Sequencing**: A specific order of steps that the program follows.
     - **Selection**: Conditional statements that direct the programâ€™s flow based on certain conditions (`if`, `else`, etc.).
     - **Iteration**: A loop to perform repeated actions (`for`, `while`, `repeat`).

   - Example:
     ```python
     def find_max(numbers):  
         max_value = numbers[0]  # Initialize max_value to the first element
         for number in numbers:  # Iterate through the list
             if number > max_value:  # Check if the current number is greater
                 max_value = number  # Update max_value
         return max_value  # Return the largest number found
     ```

   - **Comments Explanation**:
     - **Sequencing**: The steps initialize `max_value`, iterate through `numbers`, and compare values.
     - **Selection**: The `if` statement checks a condition and updates `max_value` if true.
     - **Iteration**: The `for` loop processes each element in the list.

   - Example of Calling the Algorithm:
     ```python
     scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]  # List of scores
     max_score = find_max(scores)  # Call the function to find the highest score
     print(f"The highest score is {max_score}")  # Output the result
     ```

   - **Comments Explanation**:
     - The algorithm is executed by **calling the function** with a specific list.
     - The output demonstrates the functionality of the algorithm.
